Add these songs to your work playlist and be happier and more productive. These are wordless soundscapes, so you don't have to think about anything besides the sounds; you can make up your own meanings or just zone out.
Both have a groove and energy that keep me motivated even when darkness hits way too early.

The genre of "Polish Girl" by Neon Indian is called chillwave, synthpop, or indietronica.
All three word contractions seem to describe the texture of this music.

The second video "Fires" by Tourist really hasn't gotten tons of attention, but there's something about the beat and the odd combination of sounds that puts my mind in a good place.
I like how it just keeps building and building toward the main melody at the end of the song.

<p> Critics have used words such as nuanced and stirring. Yeah it has a 20 years ago feel too, but in a good way.
<p> I'll add my last fav by Tourist, "Jupiter", a little less energetic, but still fun, and exuding the positive vibes.</p>

<p>Can't wait to hear more by Tourist. Hope they keep their unique quality and don't devolve into anonymous electro-dubstep.
<p> Let me know if you have other cool sounds for me to listen to during a workday! </p>
