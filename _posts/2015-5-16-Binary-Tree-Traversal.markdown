Binary Search Tree vs. Binary Tree
  BST: For all nodes, the left child are less than or equal to the current node. The right children are greater than or equal to the current node.
Recursive Solultions.
  BFS:
  DFS:


Binary-Tree-Traversal
  In-Order (most common)
    //left side, current node, right side.
  Post-Order
  Pre-Order

Graph Traversal:
  for BFS: QUEUE:

   or DFS

Two Problems:
Is this tree a Binary Search Tree?

Print all the paths that sum to a given value in a binary tree. The path must go down in a straight line?
