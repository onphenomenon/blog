<p>I completed my first series of timed events at the Hellyer Velodrome in San Jose, CA. Of course it was lots of fun, with great people, and the amazing announcer Michael Hernandez. Also Chris Hamilton was there to support me all day, which was awefully sweet.

I'm recording my times here, so I remember them, and I can see how far I've come my next summer. Of course I compared my times to the women's world records, which seem pretty incredible now that I've competed in the events. I am still figuring out gearing, so I used a 49 chain ring and a 16 tooth cog (82.7) for all the events. Granted I had no specialized aero equipment, it was a blustery day, and yeah, it was my first race. Can't wait to shave the seconds off my time as the season progresses and gain increased ability to handle my bike at high speeds.

This weekend I was also watching some of the amazing performances by the women at the World Cup in London, esp, Kristina Vogel and Laura Trott.
